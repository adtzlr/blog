My Name is Andreas Dutzler and I'm a University Assistent at Graz University of Technology at the Institute of Structural Durability and Railway Technology in the area of mechanical engineering.

### Research Information

In the area of computational engineering my research is focused on the mechanical description of elastomer components. Therefor I have to deal with a mathematically geometric exact description of kinematics in continuum mechanics. Up to now this investigation is limited to the case of isotropic hyperelasticity. (Some) main question are: What is (not) possible inside this framework? What are the consequences of material isotropy on work-conjugacy of stress and strain? And last but not least: What is strain? How does a generalized description of material isotropy affect the component characteristic cuvers of typical elastomer components?
